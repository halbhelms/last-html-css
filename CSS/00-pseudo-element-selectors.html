    Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike traditional frameworks like React or Vue, Svelte shifts much of the work to the compile step, converting your components into highly efficient imperative code that directly updates the DOM. This approach results in faster runtime performance and smaller bundle sizes, as there's no virtual DOM layer to manage. Svelte's syntax is simple and lean, aimed at increasing developer productivity and making the code more readable. It offers reactivity out of the box without the need for additional state management libraries. Svelte is gaining popularity for its innovative approach to web development, offering a streamlined, efficient alternative to more traditional frameworks.
