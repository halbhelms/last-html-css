<p>The best high-yield savings accounts help you grow funds faster than average accounts. The products featured on this page have annual percentage yields, or APYs, of up to 5% or more. That is many times more than the national average rate of 0.47%.</p>

<p>Because of the recent Federal Reserve rate increases, APYs are going up, making now a good time to open a high-yield savings account. The accounts featured below can help you boost your emergency fund or save up for big purchases. Check the bottom of the page for more information about how these financial products work.</p>
