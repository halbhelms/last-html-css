<p>The biggest difference between ChatGPT and Bard is the Large Language Models (LLMs) they are powered by. ChatGPT uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), while Bard uses the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMBDA). Also, ChatGPT is developed by OpenAI, while Bard was built by Google.</p>

<p>In terms of capabilities, both do very similar things. Programmers can use ChatGPT for:
Suggestions: Both models can suggest the correct syntax and parameters for functions and other code constructs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completion: It can complete code that you have started writing.</li>
  <li>Debugging: It can help you identify errors and problems in your code.</li>
  <li>Explanation: It can explain the code that it generates, or code you input.</li>
  <li>Both models were trained on a massive dataset, including Common Crawl, Wikipedia, books, articles, documents, and content scraped from the internet. However, Bard is a little different in that it was trained on conversations and dialogues from the web, while ChatGPT was trained mostly on scraped general content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both products are still under development, Bard a bit more so than ChatGPT. But to really show how these differences actually matter in a practical sense, hereâ€™s how they work when tested against each other.</p>
