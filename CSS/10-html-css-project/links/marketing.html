<h1>Marketing</h1>

<p>In a marketing plan, your business summary is exactly what it sounds like: a summary of the organization. It's essential to include this information so that all stakeholders, including your direct reports, learn about your company in detail before delving into the more strategic components of your plan.</p>

<p>Even if you’re presenting this plan to people who’ve been in the company for a while, it doesn’t hurt to get everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>Most business summaries include:

  <ul>
    <li>The company name</li>
    <li>Where it's headquartered</li>
    <li>Its mission statement</li>
  </ul>
